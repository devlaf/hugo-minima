# hugo-minima

### About
This hugo layout wraps the minima css stylesheet that was originally designed by Douglas Bowman for the early blogger community.Â  Now you can have the best of both worlds; a static site generator that allows you to write all of your content in markdown and that sweet, sweet design of the early 2000s.
